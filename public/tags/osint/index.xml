      <description>osintagram Osintagram is a Python script inspired by Palenath&amp;rsquo;s Toutatis script.
I worked by adding a few options and rewriting his code. It is obviously not perfect but I thought it would be cool to share it anyway.
That script allows you to retrieve information about an Instagram user, including their profile details, profile picture, followers, and people following. Additionally, it provides options to save the output to a file and includes enhancements such as progress indicators, interactive prompts, and colored output.</description>
